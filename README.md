### Xonix

## Background and Overview

Xonix is a classic video game that was developed in 1984. The game
starts with the player in the perimeter of the screen and the balls in
the middle. The 'balls' move freely within the field of the screen while
the player attempts to take 60% of the their space by cutting the screen
into small segments. The player drags a tail with them as they cut the
screen into segments. If a ball collides with the player or the player's
tail before they reach their claimed space again, the player loses a life.
They player will start with three lives and gain one life for each level
they pass.
